# PS6
RandWriter

In PS6, I implemented a Markov-chain based random text generator in C++ that builds a statistical model from input text by mapping each k-length substring (k-gram) to the frequency of characters that follow it, storing this in a nested map for efficient frequency queries and weighted random selection. Treating the input text as circular ensures all possible k-grams are captured. The class provides key functions such as freq to query the total frequency of a k-gram or the frequency of a specific character following it, with input validation to ensure correctness. The kRand function selects a next character randomly based on these frequencies, supporting both zero and higher-order models. The generate method uses kRand iteratively to produce a pseudo-random text sequence of specified length, starting from a given seed k-gram. Additionally, an output operator displays the modelâ€™s order, alphabet, and frequency mappings for inspection. Robust error handling, use of std::uniform_int_distribution for randomness, and careful edge-case management make this implementation a reliable and flexible tool for statistically mimicking input text in generated sequences.
